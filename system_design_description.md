# Information System Design Description

## System Overview

The Decision Hub is a web-based information system designed for multi-criteria decision analysis using various mathematical methods. The system provides a comprehensive platform for users to perform complex decision-making processes through different analytical approaches.

## Architecture Design

### 1. Layered Architecture

The system follows a **4-layer architecture pattern**:

#### **Presentation Layer (Frontend)**
- **HTML Templates**: Jinja2-based templates for dynamic content rendering
- **JavaScript**: Client-side functionality for navigation, drafts management, and file uploads
- **CSS**: Responsive design with modern styling
- **User Interface**: Intuitive web interface accessible through any modern browser

#### **Application Layer (Flask Framework)**
- **Main Application**: Central Flask app (`app.py`) handling request routing
- **Blueprint Modules**: Modular organization of functionality:
  - Hierarchy (AHP - Analytic Hierarchy Process)
  - Binary Relations Analysis
  - Expert Evaluation System
  - Decision Methods (Laplasa, Maximin, Savage, Hurwitz)
  - Drafts Management System

#### **Business Logic Layer**
- **Mathematical Methods**: Core algorithms and calculations
- **File Parser**: Excel/CSV file processing and validation
- **Excel Export**: Data export functionality with report generation
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts using Plotly
- **AI Integration**: GPT-based analysis capabilities

#### **Data Layer (PostgreSQL Database)**
- **User Management**: Authentication and user data
- **Method-Specific Tables**: Dedicated tables for each decision method
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of user actions and results
- **Drafts Storage**: Work-in-progress data persistence

### 2. Design Principles

#### **Modularity**
- Each decision method is implemented as a separate blueprint
- Business logic is organized in dedicated modules
- Clear separation of concerns between layers

#### **Scalability**
- Blueprint architecture allows easy addition of new methods
- Connection pooling for database efficiency (10 base + 20 overflow connections)
- Stateless design supporting horizontal scaling

#### **Security**
- Flask-Login authentication with password hashing
- User data isolation ensuring privacy
- Secure file upload with validation
- Complete audit trail for all operations

#### **User Experience**
- Responsive design for various devices
- Intuitive navigation between methods
- Draft saving functionality for work continuity
- Interactive visualizations for better data understanding

### 3. Data Flow Design

```
User Input → Frontend → Flask Blueprint → Business Logic → Database
     ↑                                                      ↓
Response ← Templates ← Data Processing ← Query Results ←────┘
```

**Key Flow Characteristics:**
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Clear direction from user input to database
- **State Management**: Session-based user state management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at each layer
- **Data Validation**: Input validation at multiple levels

### 4. Database Design

#### **Normalized Structure**
- Separate tables for each decision method
- Foreign key relationships maintaining data integrity
- Optimized indexes for performance

#### **Audit Capabilities**
- Results table tracking all user operations
- Timestamp and user identification for each action
- Complete history of decision-making processes

#### **Data Isolation**
- User-specific data access controls
- Secure data separation between users
- Privacy protection through proper access controls

### 5. Integration Design

#### **External Services**
- **File Upload System**: Secure handling of Excel/CSV files
- **AI Service Integration**: GPT-based analysis capabilities
- **Export Functionality**: Multi-format data export

#### **API Design**
- RESTful approach for internal communication
- Standardized response formats
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

### 6. Performance Design

#### **Optimization Strategies**
- Database connection pooling
- Efficient query design
- Client-side caching for static resources
- Optimized file processing

#### **Scalability Considerations**
- Horizontal scaling support through stateless design
- Modular architecture allowing independent scaling
- Resource management for concurrent users

### 7. Security Design

#### **Authentication & Authorization**
- Secure user authentication system
- Role-based access control
- Session management with proper timeout

#### **Data Protection**
- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection through template escaping
- Secure file upload handling

### 8. Maintainability Design

#### **Code Organization**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation
- Modular structure for easy updates

#### **Testing Strategy**
- Unit testing capabilities
- Integration testing support
- Error handling validation
- Performance monitoring
